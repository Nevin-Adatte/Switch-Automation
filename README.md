# Switch-Automation

Providing different ways to operate a bulb without physical switches

## Project Description

This project uses the Blynk API and IoT technology to create an automated switch system with added features for NFC and AR functionality. The system allows users to remotely control a switch using a smartphone app, make payments using NFC, and visualize the system in augmented reality.

The project involves connecting the switch to a microcontroller, which is then connected to the Blynk cloud platform. The Blynk app is used to create a user interface that allows users to control the switch, set schedules, and monitor the device's status. NFC functionality is added to enable payment transactions, and AR technology is incorporated to visualize the system in real-world settings.
